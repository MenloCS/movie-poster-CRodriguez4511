# Movie Poster Steps

## Step 1: Creative Brief
*(Commit message: "Completed creative brief")*

Before you open any AI tools, plan your vision. This is your anchor—return to it after every AI generation.

**Project Hail Mary:**  
- ** Project Hail Mary:**  
- **Why I chose this movie:** I really like the book, and I think sci-fi movies are really cool.

**Core Emotion:**  
What ONE feeling should a viewer get from your poster? (Examples: wonder, fear, joy, excitement, mystery, tension, nostalgia)  
- **Core emotion:**  wonder and tension

**Essential Visual Element:**  
What ONE image, object, or visual MUST appear on your poster?  
- **Essential element:** The wall that separates Rocky from Grace
- **Why this element:**  This is where the main character first meets an alien, and it's very important.

**What NOT to Include:**  
What do you definitely NOT want? (This helps you evaluate AI outputs critically.)  
- **Avoid:**  

**Color Palette:**  
- **Dominant color(s):**  
- **Accent color(s):**  
- **Overall mood:** (warm/cool/muted/vibrant/dark/bright)  

**Composition:**  
- [ ] Close-up (face/detail)   
- [ ] Wide shot (landscape/setting)  
- [x] Medium shot (full figure)  
- [x] Object/symbol centered  
- [ ] Character collage  

- **Focal point description:**  
The focal point is the middle of the image where some dim light rays meet.

## Step 2: AI Generation – First Attempts
*(Commit message: "Documented first two AI attempts")*

Open Adobe Firefly. Generate images based on your creative brief, but remember: you're exploring possibilities, not looking for a final answer.

**Attempt 1:**  
- **My prompt:** A dark background with a dim light in a closed tunnel with a side view. In the middle there's a transparent hexagon like wall/ boundary separating the tunnel. On one side you can see half of an outstretched arm. The arm is that of a caucasian human adult male and he is wearing a long sleeved blue shirt. On the other side of the boundary there is what seems to be like an arm but is dark brown and made of rocks. Instead of human fingers there are three thick stumps of rock . The light is coming from a flashlight that is not visible but is coming from the top left side of the image. The focal point is the middle of the boundary where you can see the two "hands" reaching for each other from different sides.

- **What worked:**  The arm of the human being is very accurate and the lighting is kind of what I wanted it to be. The side profile of the hands is pretty accurate 
- **What didn't work:**  IT thought the boundary wasn't what was separating the two arms and the perspective of the tunnel is wrong. Also, the arm of the alien is not accurate because it looks like a human arm made of rocks.
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  
I'll be more specific when describing the background and the arm of the alien.
**Attempt 2:**  
- **My prompt:**  
A dark background with a dim light  with a side view. In the middle there's a transparent hexagon like wall/ boundary separating the poster into two sides. On one side you can see half of an outstretched arm. The arm is that of a Caucasian human adult male, and he is wearing a space suit. On the other side of the boundary there is what seems to be an arm-like figure. It is not like a human arm, it is a rectangular like rock with three little stumps coming out of the end, it  is dark brown and made of  big rocks. The light is coming from an unknown light source that is not visible but is coming from the top left side of the image. The focal point is the middle of the boundary where you can see the two "hands" reaching for each other from different sides. Make sure it's more zoomed in.
- **What worked:**  The boundary definitely looks better now and the focal point is better.
- **What didn't work:** the arm of the alien is really bad and inaccurate.  
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  I'll try to describe the arm better so it looks more accurate.

## Step 3: AI Generation – Continued Iteration
*(Commit message: "Documented final AI attempts")*

Keep refining. Try at least two more meaningfully different directions.

**Attempt 3:**  
- **My prompt:**  
A dark background with a dim light, with a side view. In the middle, there's a big transparent hexagon-like wall/ boundary separating the poster into two sides. This wall reaches the sides of the poster, and it looks more like a force wall than glass or plastic. On one side, you can see half of an outstretched arm. The arm is that of a human adult male, and he is wearing a space suit. On the other side of the boundary, there is what seems to be an arm-like figure. It is not like a human arm; it is a rectangular rock with three little stumps coming out of the end. It is dark brown and made of small rocks. This "alien" arm is smaller, and the hand with three triangular fingers, lacking a thumb. The light is coming from an unknown light source that is not visible, but is coming from the top left side of the image and is slightly bright. The focal point is the middle of the boundary, where you can see the two "hands" reaching for each other from different sides; the rest is dimmed, and there is no other light.
- **What worked:**  Everything else looks pretty good.
- **What didn't work:** The arm is really bad. 
- **What I'll change for next attempt:** 
I will be clearer with my description of the alien's arm. 

**Attempt 4:**  
- **My prompt:**  
A dark background with a dim light with a side view. In the middle there's a big transparent hexagon like wall/ boundary separating the poster into two sides. This wall reaches the sides of the poster. On one side you can see half of an outstretched arm. The arm is that of a human adult male, and he is wearing a space suit. On the other side of the boundary there is a limb that looks like it's carved from dark, rugged stone, but moves with the fluid grace of a spider's leg, ending in a surprisingly dexterous three-pronged hand. It is not like a human arm, it is a rectangular like rock with three little stumps coming out of the end, it is dark brown and made of small rocks. The light is coming from an unknown light source that is not visible but is coming from the top left side of the image and is slightly bright. The focal point is the middle of the boundary where you can see the two "hands" reaching for each other from different sides, the rest is dimmed, there is no other light.
- **What worked:**  
- **What didn't work:**  

**Final AI Image Selected:** (Which attempt? Why?)  
My favorite one was the fourth attempt because it looked more accurate even if the alien's arm is still not what it's supposed to look like.

## Step 4: Photoshop Modifications
*(Commit message: "Added Photoshop modifications")*

Export your best AI generation and open it in Photoshop. You must make at least TWO intentional modifications. The AI gave you raw material—now make it yours.

**Modification Ideas:**
- Crop or reframe the image  
- Adjust colors, contrast, or brightness  
- Add the movie title (typography matters!)  
- Add a tagline  
- Combine elements from multiple AI generations  
- Remove unwanted elements  

**Your Modifications:**  
1.  
2.  
3. (optional)  

**Save your final poster as:** `final-poster.jpg` or `final-poster.png`  
**Drag your final poster file into your GitHub repo folder before committing.**

## Step 5: Reflection
*(Commit message: "Completed reflection")*

**How did your vision evolve?**  
Compare your original creative brief to your final poster. What changed? What stayed the same?  
My initial poster did not look like what I had expected it to look like, and the profile was wrong. My final one seems not to want to change the alien arm into what its supposed to be but overall it's kind of what I wanted it to look like.

**What decision are you most proud of that the AI didn't make for you?**  
I had the initial idea, and I added some more brightness in the focal point. I also feel like my descriptions were very detailed, and maybe the AI just didn't feel like modifying some of my changes.
**What would you do differently next time?**  
Maybe I would pick something less complicated than an alien arm and maybe I would use a different AI tool.
